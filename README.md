Data repository for "Non-relativistic conformal invariance in mesoscopic two-dimensional Fermi gases" [arXiv:2111.09893](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09893) by  authors Johannes Hofmann and Viktor Bekassy. 
The files contain primary states of the two-dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator for N=2 to N=20 fermions with spin projection up/down. Even number N of fermions correspond to an equal number of both spin types, and odd N to one excess spin. Included are all primary states up to the second non-interacting excitation level, in units of \hbar\omega. In Data_files_extra are primary states from fig. 3 in the paper. 

A primary state is characterized by
- lv: non-interacting energy, lv=0 correspond to the ground state energy, lv=1 to the first excited energy  
- E_1: the interaction energy with interaction strength g=-1
- S: spin 
- M: angular momentum 
- T: the expectation value of the Casimir operator
