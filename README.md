Data repository for "Non-relativistic conformal invariance in mesoscopic two-dimensional Fermi gases". 
The files contain primary states of the two-dimensional quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator for N=2 to N=20 fermions of two components with spin projection \uparrow.   characterized by the the non-interacting energy
